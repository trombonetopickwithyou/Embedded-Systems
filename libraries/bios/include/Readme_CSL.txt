INSTALLATION INFORMATION
------------------------
To run the TI C6000 CSL Library Installation, follow the directions below:

Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP
1. Unzip the C6xCSL.exe file to a temporary directory
2. Double Click the executable to launch the Install Shield Wizard
3. Answer all remaining questions presented in Install Shield dialog boxes


NOTES:

1) If you DO NOT accept the software license agreement the library WILL NOT be installed.

2) The default location to install the software is c:\cslc6000, which will install the
   libraries into c:\cslc6000\lib, the header files into c:\cslc6000\include and
   the examples into c:\cslc6000\examples.
   If CSL is installed over <CCS_Install_Dir>\bios\ , it will overwrite existing CSL
   version without taking any backup. So it is recommended that user take backup of
   <CCS_Install_Dir>\bios\ folder before installing CSL there.
