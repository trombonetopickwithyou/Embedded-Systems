# The first column is the import configuration files which must be created using cc_setup						
# All the configuration files must be located in %WINDIR%\ti\drivers\import

# The short description should not be too cryptic for the novice users and no two configurations should have the same short description.						
# The long description should contain any detailed information which the user may need to know						
# Enter an asterisk in a field to mean that this field does not apply to the given configuration file						
# To save this file highlight the area you want to save, copy it to the clipboard then paste it into Notepad
